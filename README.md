## Store Manager


* Created a dictionary that has a few items already stored.

* Prompted the user is they would like to add a new item, removed an existing one, or to displayed all the items currently in stock.

* If the user would like to add a new item, asked what they would like to add and how many. Added the results to your dictionary.

* If the user wanted to remove and item, first checked if that item is available then removed that item from the dictionary.

* If the user wanted to display the result printed out an easy to red list of all the items and amount to the console.
